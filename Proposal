# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

What in the music?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project will focus on playing music for the user. The user will be free to choose genre and song, or even get a random combination.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will give the user a few paths. He can choose to listen to music from 3 to 5 music genres. In each genre, there will be about 5 songs. If the user is not sure about what music to listen to, he can ask to software to summarize a genre for him and then he can decide if that works for him or not. If not, then he can ask the software to describe another genre and if he likes that, he can tell it to play a random song from there.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not doing this.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

This project will be done with Muhammad Arham. His email is tuq37520@temple.edu. His TA is Elmira Talebianaraki.

## In the world of software, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The software WILL play music and follow the user's requests accurately.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding visuals such as pause/play button.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have something fairly similar to a music streaming platform (just much more limited in terms of song choices).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to shape our overall skills to achieve this. Something that I need to focus on is randomizing the output. We will need to also find the songs that will be used and finish deciding on the genres. We will both do our contribute on ensuring that the "artistic" (music) is done and that the software is up and running.
