Learning to work with GUIs is actually very fun. I like being able to make simple lines of code actually be relatively eye-pleasing.

One of the biggest challenges was handling the MP3 files, moving them to the program, and finding a site that would let us download them as MP3 files. 

A few things we could not finish quite polishing perfectly such as the slider that although it moved and you could skip parts of the song with it, would at times freeze and move back to the beginning if the song was paused. Something else that was minor was fitting the word "previous" in its corresponding button.
